# serial_BIN_file_transfer

This Python GUI application allows users to upload `.bin` firmware files to STM32 microcontrollers over a serial (UART) connection. It is designed to work seamlessly with the [STM32F446 Bootloader](https://github.com/Vojtese/STM32F446-Bootloader), enabling easy firmware updates using a graphical interface.

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- Upload `.bin` files to STM32 flash memory via UART
- Select COM port and configure serial parameters (baud rate, parity, stop bits, flow control)
- Automatic reception feedback printed in GUI
- Simple and intuitive interface for testing and deployment
- Compatible with STM32 bootloader IAP protocol

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `guiAPP.py`: Main GUI application logic
- `main.py`: Entry point for launching the GUI
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## üß™ How to Use

1. Connect your STM32 device via USB or serial adapter.
2. Launch the GUI by running `main.py`.
3. Select the `.bin` file you want to upload.
4. Choose the correct COM port and configure serial settings.
5. Click **SEND** to transmit the firmware.
6. Monitor the feedback window for transmission status and response.
